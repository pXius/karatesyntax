# Karate Framework Syntax Highlighting

## Description

This extension adds proper syntax highlighting to files written using the Karate Test framework. More specifically, it applies highlights to `.feature` files.

## Recommended❗️

- For the best experience, install the *[Karate Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pxius.karate-extension-pack)* which includes this plugin.

Alternatively you can install a theme of your own or use the [Carbon Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pxius.carbon-owl) theme (pictured below and part of extension pack).

To enjoy perfectly formatted `.feature` files, install [Cucumber Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete) (also part of extension pack).
