# Karate Framework Syntax Highlighting

## Description

This extension adds proper syntax highlighting to files written using the Karate Test framework. More specifically, it applies highlights to `.feature` files.

## Recommended
This extension will work just fine on it's own, however it's best used with the [Carbon Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pxius.carbon-owl) theme.

For an even better experience, install the [Cucumber Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete), and enjoy perfectly formatted `.feature` files.
